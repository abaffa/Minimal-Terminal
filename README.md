# Baffa Terminal (minimal-terminal clone)

This is a Simple Terminal board based on "Minimal-Terminal" project by Carsten Herting (oct/2021 https://github.com/slu4coder/Minimal-Terminal).

There are some few changes in my version like US-International keyboard mapping, other serial speeds (115200, 57600, 38400, 9600 BPS support) and "almost" RC2014 pinout. 
I'm using this board with my CP/M machine (see http://baffa-2.baffasoft.com.br)

### RC2014 Minimal-Terminal Module
This is an untested version of the Minimal Terminal for RC2014 kit, based on "Baffa-2 Terminal v2".
