# Baffa Terminal (minimal-terminal clone)

This is a Simple Terminal board based on "Minimal-Terminal" project by Carsten Herting (oct/2021 https://github.com/slu4coder/Minimal-Terminal).

Current version supports US-International keyboard mapping, four basic serial speeds (115200, 57600, 38400, 9600 BPS) and [supports some basic CSI/Ansi escapes](supported_escapes.md).
 
The prototype board has been tested with my CP/M machine (see http://baffa-2.baffasoft.com.br) but there is another board compatible with RC2014 pinout.
